# PIC12_Evaluation_board
kicad project of my custom PIC12 evaluation board

I'm Enrico and i am FCT board tester. I designed this board for rapid design of 8 pin microcontroller application that support my work.


The pic 12 board include:

-PICKIT connector on board.

-Large build area.

-Double Power supply from usb connector or from CR2032 battery for portable applications.

-Supports pullup and pulldown resistors for every pin.

-BOM is displayed on bottom silkscreen side.
